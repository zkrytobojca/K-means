# K-means

## About
This machine learning project was about clustering algorithm called K-means. It was written from scratch as an algorithmic exercise. 

This project included:
- K-means clustering implementation
- Importing data from .CSV files
- Determinig the number of clusters (k)
- 4 different distance metrics
- Implementation of grouping quality measure - Silhouette

## Technologies used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Highlights
Algorithm was tested on a few different datasets with diverse attribute numbers and arrangement of objects. All tests gave satisfactory results.
